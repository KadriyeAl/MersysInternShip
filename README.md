Mersys Internship Project - Rest Assured

This project focuses on developing and testing RESTful APIs using Rest Assured, a Java-based library specifically designed for API testing. It is part of the Mersys internship program, aimed at equipping participants with skills in API development, testing, and automation.

Project Objectives:


API Testing Automation: Implement automated tests for RESTful APIs to ensure their reliability and performance.
Validation of API Responses: Verify the correctness of HTTP status codes, response payloads, and headers.
Integration with Test Frameworks: Combine Rest Assured with testing frameworks like JUnit or TestNG for structured and efficient testing.
Hands-on Experience: Gain practical exposure to real-world API testing scenarios.

Key Features:

End-to-End Testing: Cover all aspects of API testing, including functional, integration, and regression tests.
Dynamic Request Building: Handle dynamic query parameters, path parameters, and request bodies.
Response Parsing: Extract and validate data from JSON and XML responses.
Authentication Mechanisms: Test APIs with various authentication methods, such as OAuth, Basic Auth, and Token-based authentication.
This project provides a solid foundation for understanding the principles of RESTful APIs and enhances automation skills critical for backend and API development.
